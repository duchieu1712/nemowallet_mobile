The core principle is to use automated tools & technologies to oversee the value of NEMO tokens. NEMO value is pegged to the price of another asset, hence the term 'stable'. Now, NEMO is valued at 0.1 USDT. 1 NEMO = 0.1$ (USTD) NEMO Token is also a common co-use currency for all projects on NEMO Platform. NEMO is a critical material for Land owners and players participated in GaliXCity. Since, they will need to use NEMO to upgrade LAND or city. The higher the level, the more NEMOs are required. Aside from obtaining NEMO token through trading, players can also receive NEMO Tokens when participating in in-game PvE, PvP, AvA activities. NSF (NEMO Stability Facility) is a special purpose instrument designed to maintain the stability of NEMO exchange rate by managing the treasury and supporting stable NEMO buying/selling activities on anti-de-peg platforms, with a guarantee mechanism for both NEMO/USDT liquidity. NSS (NEMO Stimulation System) includes fiscal tools that assist with increasing the spending on NEMO System, reducing short-term interest rate and cutting down on item exchange fees. Both NSF and NSS have a range of tools that can be used to stimulate demand and economic growth, and provide stable and long-lasting NEMO for all three targeted audiences: • Player/User • Holders/Investor • Studio/Publisher",
